Users can log in, change password, create recipes, favorite recipes and many other functionalities that are typical and atypical to CRUD apps alike and get recommendation from an algorithm. Finally, to breathe life into the platform, I web scraped over 1000 recipes from the internet from scratch, encoded them in base64 then let the website render it.",
